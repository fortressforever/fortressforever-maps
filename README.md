## Setting up Hammer

1. **Install Source SDK**
  * In Steam, go to the Library tab and select *Tools* from the dropdown
  * Find *Source SDK* in the list and install it
2. **Install Source SDK Base 2006** (this ideally wouldn't be necessary, [see issue #4](https://github.com/fortressforever/fortressforever-maps/issues/4))
  * In Steam, go to the Library tab and select *Tools* from the dropdown
  * Find *Source SDK Base 2006* in the list and install it
3. **Setup Source SDK**
  * Run Source SDK once (it will install some misc files and set the `sourcesdk` environment variable for you). Close it once it is finished.
  * Download and run [`setup.bat`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortressforever/fortressforever-maps/master/setup.bat)
4. **Launch Hammer**
  * Open Source SDK
  * Select *Source Engine 2006* as the *Engine Version* and *Fortress Forever* as the *Current Game*
  * Double click *Hammer Editor* under the *Applications* heading
